      "project_two":"The project is a full-stack application developed with React that incorporates both REST and GraphQL API clients, along with user authentication powered by Firebase. The RESTful client allows users to interact with any REST API, providing essential features like a method selector (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), a text input for entering API endpoint URLs, and a request body editor for sending data in requests such as POST or PUT.The project also integrates Firebase Authentication, enabling users to register, log in, and manage authentication seamlessly. Firebase ensures secure authentication for users, which is critical for handling requests that require user sessions.",
      "project_one":  "In addition to the REST client, the project also includes a GraphiQL client to interact with GraphQL APIs.This client offers a query editor where users can write and execute GraphQL queries or mutations, a variables editor for passing dynamic data, and a headers editor for customizing the HTTP request. It features an input field for the GraphQL schema documentation endpoint and includes a documentation explorer that enables users to browse and interact with the API schema (SDL). The response section displays the results, including data or errors. Moreover, the project supports language interpolation, allowing dynamic content based on user-selected languages. This ensures the UI can be easily localized, providing a personalized experience for users from different regions.",
