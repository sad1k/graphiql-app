    and GraphQL API clients, along with user authentication powered by Firebase. The RESTful client 
    allows users to interact with any REST API, providing essential features like a method selector 
    (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), a text input for entering API endpoint URLs, and a request body 
    editor for sending data in requests such as POST or PUT.The project also i
    ntegrates Firebase Authentication, enabling users to register, log in, and manage authentication seamlessly. 
    Firebase ensures secure authentication for users, which is critical for handling requests that require user sessions.`,

    This client offers a query editor where users can write and execute GraphQL queries or mutations, a variables editor

    GraphQL schema documentation endpoint and includes a documentation explorer that enables users to browse and interact 
    with the API schema (SDL). The response section displays the results, including data or errors. Moreover, the project 
    supports language interpolation, allowing dynamic content based on user-selected languages. This ensures the UI can be easily localized, providing a personalized 
    experience for users from different regions.`,
